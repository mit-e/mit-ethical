# The MIT Ethical License

The MIT Ethical License is an extension of the MIT license that prohibits the usage of software in an unethical maner. 

The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) does not support restricting individuals from using software.  While the MIT-E understands this, in principle, we also cannot ethically stand by while people use software to bring harm to society. The goal of this license is to support open source but discourage the usage of software for unethical means.
